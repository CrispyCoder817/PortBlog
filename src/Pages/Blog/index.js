              <p>Here we go again, the endless quest for the job continues to be hunted down.
                There is no telling how far we will go for greatness; some spend thousands of dollars to figure out and some more than others.
                I went through an entire undergrad only to get another set of schooling under my belt. Graphic design is great and all, but I can't support an entire family with GD money.
                There was a time where I thought I'd be working at big time companies doing big time things; sadly not yet. I know for a fact I am capable of creating award-winning content, so I need to start.
                This is exactly why I went on to figure myself into a coding bootcamp and take on the ultimate task of getting a web dev job and use my graphic design background to aide my efforts.

                Please realize quicker than you could that whoever is right for the job isn't alwasy going to get it.
                The amount of network that goes in to securing a certain position is likely to always be the person they know the most.
                Thus, this is why it is paramount to network your ass of to succeed. It truly is about who you know rather than what you do.
                My jobs have been born out of desperation from both ends and the relationship is nice during the honeymoon phase but dies out as the time goes on.
                Feel free to apply this to all matters of life - rather - encouraged.

                The last piece of the day before returning to work; keep making progress everyday whether its a fraction of a percent or a whole leap of a jump.
                You will conquor what is necessary so long as you stay focused and calm about the trial to your destination.
                It isn't an easy road to anything you want so dearly in life; whether it's a family or a full time job. It takes an unsurpassable amount of work to achieve, but it's refreshing that it's always available to work on.

              <h2>Sitcoms -- Reality</h2>
              <p>
                Today we went through the idea of creating the sitcom of our lives today.
                It was one of the most pleasant conversation starters and it had the audacity to be conceited again.
                I am not one to be the first to speak or eat; never was my motive. I also cannot recall why I do or do not in that specific situation.
                We would make a great sitcome simply because we feel original for the non metaphysical folk that understand who people are for themselves rather than others.
                Part of my blog today is to create a sense of realistic instead of falsifying one's actions for clout. That got old the first time I witnessed it.
                Dinner was an entirely fresh experience for the same thing we've done so many times. Absolutely magical.
