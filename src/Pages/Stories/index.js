            <p>This is where all the fictional stories of life are going to be included in the website.
                Here is going to be the no holds barred nity gritty. Perhaps itll save you from going absolutely postal
                because your job overworks you and you are severely underpaid for what you accomplish for them day in and day fucking out.
                The rant is not over until the light is bright and bountiful.
