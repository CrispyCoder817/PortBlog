              <h2>This is the beginning</h2>
              <p>Here we go again, the endless quest for the job continues to be hunted down.
                There is no telling how far we will go for greatness; some spend thousands of dollars to figure out and some more than others.
                I went through an entire undergrad only to get another set of schooling under my belt. Graphic design is great and all, but I can't support an entire family with GD money.
                There was a time where I thought I'd be working at big time companies doing big time things; sadly not yet. I know for a fact I am capable of creating award-winning content, so I need to start.
                This is exactly why I went on to figure myself into a coding bootcamp and take on the ultimate task of getting a web dev job and use my graphic design background to aide my efforts.

                Please realize quicker than you could that whoever is right for the job isn't alwasy going to get it.
                The amount of network that goes in to securing a certain position is likely to always be the person they know the most.
                Thus, this is why it is paramount to network your ass of to succeed. It truly is about who you know rather than what you do.
                My jobs have been born out of desperation from both ends and the relationship is nice during the honeymoon phase but dies out as the time goes on.
                Feel free to apply this to all matters of life - rather - encouraged.

                The last piece of the day before returning to work; keep making progress everyday whether its a fraction of a percent or a whole leap of a jump.
                You will conquor what is necessary so long as you stay focused and calm about the trial to your destination.
                It isn't an easy road to anything you want so dearly in life; whether it's a family or a full time job. It takes an unsurpassable amount of work to achieve, but it's refreshing that it's always available to work on.

              <h2>Sitcoms -- Reality</h2>
              <p>
                Today we went through the idea of creating the sitcom of our lives today.
                It was one of the most pleasant conversation starters and it had the audacity to be conceited again.
                I am not one to be the first to speak or eat; never was my motive. I also cannot recall why I do or do not in that specific situation.
                We would make a great sitcome simply because we feel original for the non metaphysical folk that understand who people are for themselves rather than others.
                Part of my blog today is to create a sense of realistic instead of falsifying one's actions for clout. That got old the first time I witnessed it.
                Dinner was an entirely fresh experience for the same thing we've done so many times. Absolutely magical.

              <h2>Pushing through</h2>
              <p>
                Today creates a new reality for tomorrow. What you do today impacts the rest of your life. I recently heard a quote from Mr. Denzel Washington about the ghosts that are at our deathbed.
                It made me think deep upon the idea - imagine the people you could have become had you pushed on a little bit more in your hardships as ghosts at your death bed. It blew rattled my current situation and convinced me further to puruse harder and figure it out until it's done.
                We are creatures of habit - thus bad habits create a lesser life than what we would have if we only pushed a little bit more each day to our actual goals. Stop worrying about making someone else's dream happen and burning yourself out for your own dreams.
                My dream is to be a website application developer through react and the only way I'll get there is to keep working on this website until it lands me the next step in my future. If it takes me every lunch period I have so be it; at the least I'm keeping myself up and at it.
                We only fail when we give up on pushing through. As someone once said - 'lessons are taught until they are learned.' Will you keep learning or will you absorb the knowledge and figure it out for the next task that is adequate of your blood, sweat and tears?
                Whether you can or can't you will.

              <h2>What it's all about</h2>
              <p>
                Today sounded like a proverbial hellscape so far. Almost nothing went right at work today and it got to my mental so hard it's unreal.
                Perhaps I can learn from this and stop being so frustrated all the time when things don't go smooth. On the other hand are things supposed to be this rough when it comes to daily work tasks?
                Are things supposed to only work sometimes and the rest is wondering what went wrong when it's something new everytime? I recently overcame covid as did most of my small group of coworkers.
                We kept adding to our job tickets without hesitation because business is booming; enough booming for an extra set of hands to keep the overflow to a minimal.
                I have no idea what to do about it other than find another place of employment, thus creating a blog about real life content to showcase to a future employer.
                There's no telling when it'll happen, but we'll keep the light going until then. I almost don't even want to go back to work. Take whatever last paycheck I have and just hunt hard for a coding job.
                It's slightly harsher with being the big blind in this exact situation; it'll be easier in a few years when it's not the case. No worries either way because this is what garnishes our character.
                Perhahs.

                <h2>One Step at a time</h2>
                <p>
                  I started an etsy account almost a week ago - business is not booming by any means at all. I keep reminding myself that good things take time and effort.
                  I've put on some solid work for prints - 8.5x11 so we can easily order them until we make enough money for our printer. Then again, who knows if that'll ever happen.
                  The easy part is etsy only charges twenty cents to post a product every few months so even if we never make a sale it's not like we're going broke giving it a solid go.
                  I wish it was the other way anytime soon because I cannot wait for the next chapter of work to start. I don't anticipate it to be without problems; rather problems I actually care to solve.
                  Graphic design is cool, but if you're working at a print shop or a newspaper you're not going to be too thrilled with the constant stream of bullshit that carry's through. I am grateful for the opportunities, but when will it pay off?
                  Working the stock market is as bad if not worse than the lottery in some capacity - there's science to it but it's also a gamble that could be great today and worse tomorrow. 
                  Here we all are looking to grind even farther for a furthered lifestyle. I only hope it pays off for you or me someday.

                <h2>Someday</h2>
                <p>Someday I'm going to be a senior developer at a really successful company and love my life regardless of how much stress and anguish that entails.
                  Web dev is the absolute craziest, awesome idea I have the chance to learn daily and conquer regularly. Perhaps not now but sometime soon I'll catch my break and go beyond anything imagineable before.
                  I'm already done with the core graphic design life - it's great for helping web dev but it's not helping my mental state work around problems that shouldn't be problems. Don't get me wrong I'm always on the frontline of attacking the problem first and foremost.
                  There's nothing I can't figure out with enough time and effort - which I have plenty of - then again not really. You want all this done before tomorrow's end and you waited til 4:30 to tell me about it? Sure, but I can't gaurantee the highest level of quality with a half hour today and only some time tomorrow.
                  You want me to stay late after work? - Hard no I have my own things I need to get done after work. Like getting a ticket out of this never ending hellscape.
                  I'm not one to constantly complain - but have some boundaries for yourselves out there. Employers love to 'lovebomb' - a term only recently found out about. If you know it - great if not google it.
                  You'll be waited on hand and foot only to be asked to break your back for a few dollars in comparison to the people running the show - when will employees have the upper hand in this toxicity?
                  The people who make all the money for a single entity. Without employees there's zero employers. Unless you're like me and find it important to be able to self sufficently do every aspect of the business all on your own.

              <h2>Next Step</h2>
              <p>
                Today I applied to one of the biggest tech companies of all time. It felt amazing - All thanks to my wonderful girlfriend, future wife, helping gather the support and materials to catapult me forward.
                There was something stopping me from doing it before; however, knowing that the internet is wide open I could have done this anytime before. Why I didn't is a lame reason of not believing in myself.
                If you believe you can achieve. That's the intent of implementation with every single stride forward.
                The real killer is giving up midway through and failing to push on forward when the time is toughest.
                It's about making that next step toward success when it's harshest that creates the best character.
                Development is the never ending improvement whether it's in code or on the street.

                <h2>Desperation Instead Patience</h2>
                <p>
                  When on the hunt one creates a certain instance to achieve that deems sucess. This instance takes patience instead of desperation to achieve maximum success.
                  Don't count out the luck anyone can encounter during the process, but don't lean on it for sucess. 
                  Patience is the idea of waiting for the opportune moment, rather than the waiting of success to happen on it's own.
                  We simply cannot wait around for gold to find us, rather an active hunt for success. Sometimes we need peace and quiet to understand the reality of the situation.
                  Inner focus is a variable for all and should not be slept on. Know when to distract from the goal so the goal chase can always be a fresh instance. Rituals of focus are neccesary to ensure sucess.
                  There are billions of distractions; choose wisely. You could be sitting watching netflix for two hours or you could be out there learning a new skill for a new tomorrow.
                  Find someone who loves you so much they're willing to change their entire life around so you can go be better. It doesn't fit all the niches of a ideal relationship, but ideal is for the bird; pick whatever works for you the best.
